# Portfolio-Risk-Analysis
This project analyzes the risk of a financial portfolio by calculating the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for both the portfolio and individual assets. It provides insights into the risk contributions and volatility of each asset through beta and marginal VaR calculations.
